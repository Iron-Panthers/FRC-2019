### What is this directory? ###

This file is a placeholder for the robot/commands directory, which
aims to provide an explanation as to why this directory exists.

The structure for the placement of commands is roughly as follows:

Subsystems have their commands located at [subsystem root dir]/commands/[Command.java].

If there is a command which will require use of multiple subsystems, put that command in this folder. 

If/when commands exist in this directory, this file can be deleted.
